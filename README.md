# RISC-V-5th-sem

This repository contains lab exercises completed during the 5th semester of engineering for the RISC-V course. These labs focus on practical applications of RISC-V architecture, utilizing the Ripes tool for simulation and assembly. Explore and enhance your understanding of RISC-V through hands-on exercises.

## Virtual Box Installation

https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
* Follow the link to access the downloads page. Download and install the Windows host version of the software.
* Launch the VirtualBox application and select "New."
* Provide a name for the virtual machine (VM) and designate the folder location for your VM files.
* Obtain the ISO file by installing the image from the specified websites.
  * For Ubuntu: http://ubuntu-releases.mirror.net.in/ubuntu/releases/jammy/ubuntu-22.04.3-desktop-amd64.iso
* Choose and download one of the two ISO files, then include it in the ISO option.
* For the type, select "Linux," and for the version, choose "Ubuntu 22.04 (64-bit)."
* Keep the rest of the settings at their default values. If you encounter any issues at this stage, please feel free to direct message either one of us for assistance.
* Click "Next," and for the base memory, set it to "2048MB" if you have less than 8GB RAM. If you have more, set it to "4096MB."
* For the processors, leave it at "1" unless you have 4 or more cores. If you have more than 4 cores, you can set it to "2."
* Click "Next," and in the "Create a virtual hard disk now" section, set it to either 50GB or 100GB. Ensure you have enough space, but note that the allocated space is dynamic and will only use up to 100GB when necessary.
* Click "Next" and then "Finish."

## RISC-V GCC Compiler

* To obtain the RISC-V GCC compiler, navigate to the following link: https://www.embecosm.com/resources/tool-chain-downloads/. Download and install the tar.gz file that corresponds to your Linux version. It's crucial to perform this installation on the Virtual Machine.
* For Ubuntu
