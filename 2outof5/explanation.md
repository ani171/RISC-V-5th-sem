A number encoded in 2 out of 5 code, for an 8-bit representation, satisfies both of the following conditions:
1. The most significant 3 bits ([7:5]) are all zeros.
2. In the least significant 5 bits ([4:0]), there are exactly 2 occurrences of the binary digit 1 out of the 5 bits.

Steps
1. Retrieve an 8-bit unsigned number from memory and store it in a register.
2. Apply a mask to isolate and retain the bits [7:5] while disregarding [4:0].
3. Verify if the outcome from step 2 is non-zero. If it is not, Condition 1 fails, indicating that it does not conform to the 2 out of 5 code. Consequently, skip steps 4, 5, and 6, and declare it as not satisfying the 2 out of 5 criteria. Proceed to the next steps only if Condition 1 is true.
4. Initialize a counter to 5.
5. Count the occurrences of binary digit 1 in the [4:0] bits of the number using an appropriate counting logic.
6. Examine whether the count obtained in step 5 is equal to 2. If this condition is met, it signifies that there are precisely 2 instances of the binary digit 1 in [4:0], satisfying Condition 2. Declare that the number adheres to the 2 out of 5 code and proceed to step 8. If Condition 2 is not met, proceed to step 7.
7. Perform the necessary actions in case the count in step 5 is not equal to 2. This indicates that the 2 out of 5 criteria are not satisfied.
8. Conclude the process based on the outcomes of the previous steps.
